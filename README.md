This is a hacky fix for the Minecraft mod [notenoughwands'](https://github.com/romelo333/notenoughwands1.8.8). Currently it fixes the mod's PotionWand, allowing potion effects to be added to the wand. 

Feel free to download the .jar in the releases section.

Todo: remove potion effects from wand with empty bottle.
